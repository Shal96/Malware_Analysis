# Malware_Analysis

Colonial Pipeline Company Americas one of the biggest oil pipeline companies suffered a major ransom ware attack this May, the result of the attack resulted in disruption of fuel supply to major states in the country. This is just one example of the recent attack and many more can be added to the list. Thus, we can understand the gravity of the issue and realize how important it is to solve this problem. The goal of our project is to help the malware analysts analyze the origin, the functionalities and impact of such malwares. Understanding this can help us curb the problem in a much more efficient way.
Prior research in this domain throws light on many methods that have been implemented to understand this problem, one such method is using image based deep learning to classify the type of android malware into its correct category. Another method suggests Entropy analysis based on dynamic characteristics of the malware to understand its behavior in a controlled environment. This helps us to understand the type of malware and potential threats that come along with its malicious characteristics. Our classification model will focus on reducing the workload of a Malware analyst firstly by categorizing different types of malwares into their respective categories and secondly by simulating a use case wherein the classifier would classify the dataset into 2 categories i.e., before the emulator reboots and after the emulator reboots. The pattern generated could potentially help malware analyst to understand the impact of the malware and degree of its maliciousness. We limit our scope to dynamic analysis of softwareâ€™s since it has not been extensively worked upon. However, in future scope we would like to expand our classifier to study combination of static and dynamic analysis features.
